#13 Ways of Looking At Web Books


##1. A Web Book

It's so much easier to talk about something when you have something to talk about.

When talking about web books, I like to look at Jeremy Keith's [Resilient Web Design](https://resilientwebdesign.com/). I think of this as the state of the art for books on the web today. Let's start reading. 


##2. Ideas of Order

What's important about books fits in a single sentenceâ€”chapter two comes after chapter one, but they're both part of the book.

With RWD, we have a landing page with a table of contents. We can click on "Introduction," which comes next. Or there's the same link from the "begin reading now" text. 

If you're using Opera 12, you can read the entire book just by clicking the space bar. That's because of the magic of rel=next, HTML's way of defining a sequence of documents. Sadly, current browsers don't seem to do much with the [sequential link types](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#sequential-link-types).

##3. It's late; I'll read the rest tomorrow.



##4.  Search

What if I want to find something in the book? I hit command-F in my browser, and I can search the current document, but not the book. I have to go to google and type a search term followed by site:resilientwebdesign.com.

In my ebook reader, this kind of thing is easy.
